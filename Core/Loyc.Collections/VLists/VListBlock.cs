	/// <summary>
	/// VListBlock implements the core functionality of FVList, VList, FWList and 
	/// WList. It is not intended to be used directly.
	/// </summary><remarks>
	/// VList is a persistent list data structure described in Phil Bagwell's 2002
	/// paper "Fast Functional Lists, Hash-Lists, Deques and Variable Length
	/// Arrays". I (David P) call the .NET equivalent "FVList" or "forward VList".
	/// In the forward VList, the "beginning" of the list (index 0) is by far the 
	/// fastest place to insert items.
	/// <para/>
	/// This is unnatural in .NET, so I also created a second data structure, the
	/// "reverse" VList, originally called RVList, in which the end of the list 
	/// (index Count-1) is the natural location for adding items. To achieve this, 
	/// the VList sees the same elements as a FVList, but in reverse order.
	/// <para/>
	/// FWList and WList are the names I picked for the mutable (Writable) 
	/// variants of FVList and VList.
	/// <para/>
	/// A persistent list is a list that is normally considered immutable, so
	/// adding an item implies creating a new list rather than changing the one
	/// you've got. This is fast because persistent lists have a sort of
	/// copy-on-write semantics, so that "copying" a list is a trivial O(1)
	/// operation, but modifying a list is sometimes quite inefficient. My 
	/// implementation of VLists presents a mutable IList(of T) interface, but 
	/// this is only to adhere to .NET Framework conventions. FVList and VList 
	/// are value types that update their own references to the list when they are 
	/// modified. Thus, "Copying" a list is done with a simple assignment 
	/// statement. For example:
	/// <code lang="C#">
	/// VList&lt;int&gt; a = new VList&lt;int&gt;(), b = new VList&lt;int&gt;();
	/// a.Add(1);
	/// a.Add(2);
	/// b = a;             // copy the list
	/// a.Add(3);          // a[0] is 1, a[1] is 2, a[2] is 3
	/// b.Add(97);         // b[0] is 1, b[1] is 2, b[2] is 97
	/// </code>
	/// Traditionally, this kind of behavior was accomplished with singly-linked
	/// lists, but FVList does it with (in essence) a singly-linked list of arrays
	/// and thereby saves memory while allowing some operations to be done faster
	/// than they were done with linked lists. In pathological cases, however, FVList
	/// can use much more memory than a linked list and degenerate so that its
	/// performance characteristics are almost as bad as a linked list. One major 
	/// problem that comes to mind is if you keep changing the last item:
	/// <code lang="C#">
	/// VList&lt;int&gt; list = new VList&lt;int&gt;();
	/// ... add some items to list ...
	/// for(int n;; n++)
	///     list[list.Count-1] = n;
	/// </code>
	/// Unlike, for example, a C++-based FVList implementation, it is impossible for
	/// the FVList or VList, which are value types, to know if the list has been 
	/// "copied" or not. In case the list has been copied, changing any element 
	/// requires a copy to be made of the VListBlock that contains that element, as 
	/// well as any subsequent blocks (in this example, only the last block must be 
	/// copied). Thus, the above example produces a lot of garbage very quickly; in 
	/// fact the rate of garbage production is (very roughly) proportional to the 
	/// list length. The performance will be equally bad if you repeatedly remove 
	/// the last item and then re-add it.
	/// <para/>
	/// Since this kind of problem tends to get worse as the list gets larger, Phil
	/// Bagwell proposed using a two- or three-dimentional list arrangement so that
	/// no single block could exceed a certain size. I have not implemented that
	/// suggestion due to lack of free time and because I did not understand the
	/// details of his suggested implementation, but I have placed a size limit of
	/// 1024 elements on any given block. Unfortunately, this means that some
	/// operations listed below degrade toward O(N) when the list is large, most 
	/// notably including the indexer, which requires over 1000 iterations to look 
	/// up element zero in a VList that has one million elements.
	/// <para/>
	/// Due to the slow performance you get from operations like this, I decided 
	/// to implement FWList, a mutable version of the FVList, which I'll discuss 
	/// later.
	/// <para/>
	/// Similarly to a persistent linked list,
	/// <ul>
	/// <li>Adding an item to the front of a VList or the end of a VList is always
	///   O(1) in time, and often O(1) in space (though, unlike a linked list, it
	///   may be much more)</li>
	/// <li>Removing an item from the front of a VList or the end of a VList is 
	///   O(1) in time, although space not necessarily reclaimed.</li>
	/// <li>Adding or removing an item at the end of a VList or the front of an 
	///   VList is O(N) and requires making a copy of the entire list.</li>
	/// <li>Inserting or removing a list of M items at the end of a VList or the 
	///   front of a VList is O(N + M).</li>
	/// <li>Changing an item at an arbitrary position should be avoided, as it
	///   performs as poorly as inserting or removing an item at that position.</li>
	/// </ul>
	/// VLists, however, offer some operations that singly-linked lists cannot 
	/// provide efficiently:
	/// <ul>
	/// <li>Access by index averages O(1) in ideal conditions</li>
	/// <li>Getting the list length is typically O(log N), but O(1) in my version</li>
	/// <li>If a sublist points somewhere within a larger list, its index within the
	///   larger list can be obtained in between O(1) and O(log N) time.
	///   Consequently, reverse enumeration is possible without creating a 
	///   temporary stack or list.</li>
	/// </ul>
	/// Also, VLists can (in the best cases) store data almost as compactly as
	/// ordinary arrays.
	/// <para/>
	/// I suspect FVList(of T) and VList(of T) almost always outperforms 
	/// LinkedList(of T) in both time and space, if you are always adding and
	/// removing items at the correct end of the list. And it should perform as 
	/// well as List(of T) in some situations while providing an illusion of 
	/// immutability that List(of T) can't. For lists of 0 to 2 items, FVList and 
	/// VList use less space than List(of T) (in fact, no object is allocated 
	/// for an empty FVList or VList.)
	/// <para/>
	/// The FWList is built on the same foundation as the FVList (a linked list of
	/// VListBlock objects whose size increases exponentially), but it allows 
	/// you to modify the list just like List&lt;T&gt;. FWList is a hybrid 
	/// mutable-immutable data structure: a single list can be partly mutable 
	/// and partly immutable. More specifically, a FWList is conceptually divided 
	/// into two "halves": the front half is mutable, and the tail half is 
	/// immutable. The two halves need not be the same size (in fact, very often 
	/// one half is zero-size).
	/// <para/>
	/// Because some or all of a FWList can be immutable, a VList can be converted
	/// to a FWList, or vice versa, in typically O(log N) time. If you modify a 
	/// FWList after calling its ToFVList() method, a portion of the list is first 
	/// copied into a mutable block and then modified, and this copy operation 
	/// typically takes O(N) time.
	/// <para/>
	/// WList is like FWList except that new items are added at index Count 
	/// instead of index zero. The head of a FWList is at index 0 and is returned 
	/// from the First property; the head of an WList is at index Count-1 and is
	/// returned from the Last property.
	/// <para/>
	/// VListBlock implements a single "node" or "sub-array" within a VList. It
	/// contains a fixed-size array. When adding a new item to a VListBlock that
	/// is already full, a new empty VListBlock is created (with a larger array),
	/// whose _prior reference points to the old VListBlock. See Phil Bagwell's 
	/// paper (or Wikipedia) for details.
	/// <para/>
	/// VListBlock adds one new member to the structure Phil Bagwell described,
	/// PriorCount, a count of elements in other (smaller) lists to which this list
	/// is linked. This makes TotalCount an O(1) operation instead of O(log N),
	/// which is necessary so that VList[i] and WList[i] are O(1) on average.
	/// <para/>
	/// Independent instances of FVList, VList, FWList and WList can be accessed 
	/// from independent threads even though they may share some of the same 
	/// memory. Individual instances of these objects, however, are not 
	/// synchronized.
	/// <para/>
	/// A few LINQ-style methods like Select and Where are implemented on the four 
	/// data structures. These are provided to optimize functional code that takes 
	/// an input list and produces an output list, but might not actually change 
	/// the list. If all, or the tail, of the output is the same as the output,
	/// then the output list will share memory with the input list.
	/// <para/>
	/// Note that unlike LINQ methods, these methods are greedy. They perform the 
	/// requested operation immediately, not as-needed.

		/// just an illusion, after all). 
		/// <para/>
		/// I have not concerned myself with thread safety when a single VList 
		/// instance (whether mutable or immutable) is accessed from multiple 
		/// threads, because doing so is not supported. It occurs to me, however,

		/// <para/>
		/// Theoretically you shouldn't modify an FWList/WList while it is being
		/// enumerated, but the danger is limited to an incorrect sequence of

		/// <para/>
		/// Important things to note: 
		/// (1) once items are switched from mutable to immutable, they can never

		/// (2) mutable items always belong to exactly one FWList or one WList,
		///     but a VListBlock doesn't know what FWList it belongs to. A FWList 
		///     or WList is detached from its VListBlock when Clear() is called,
		///     making the block immutable again.
		/// (3) if not all the items in a VListBlock are mutable, then the Prior 
		///     list is guaranteed to be immutable. In other words, mutable and 
		///     immutable items are not interleaved; mutable items are always at 
		///     the "front" and immutable items are always at the "back" (which
		///     is the beginning of a VList or end of an FVList).

			//      |____3|   |Imm_3|   |Imm_3|-->|Imm_3|   block 4
			//      |____2|-->|____2|   |____2|   |____2|   unowned
			//      |____1|   |____1|-->|____1|   |____1|-->|Imm_1|
			//      |Imm_0|   |____0|   |____0|   |____0|   |____0|
			//
			// (The location of "Imm" in each block denotes ImmCount, which is 
			// 1, 4, 4, 4, and 2 in blocks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. The 
			// arrow --> denotes the Prior list; for example, block 0's Prior
			// list points to block 1 and Prior._localCount==3.)
			//
			// In this example the chains have sizes of 8, 3, 2, 4, 2 from w's

			// change the block sizes if desired, although there is another

			// to make the 0th item mutable. But if block 0 had no immutable 
			// items, there would be no need to copy it; we'd only need to copy 
			// blocks 1 and 2. In that case, this code would combine blocks 1
