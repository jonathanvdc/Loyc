	/// <summary>
	/// A wrapper around <see cref="Stopwatch"/> with a more convenient interface,
	/// currently oriented around measuring milliseconds 
	/// (TODO: increase similarity to <c>Stopwatch</c>)
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// EzStopwatch is a wrapper around the normal <see cref="Stopwatch"/> that
	/// is less clumsy to use: you can get the elapsed time and restart the 
	/// timer from zero with a single call to Restart(). The Stopwatch class
	/// (prior to .NET 4, anyway) requires you to make three separate method 
	/// calls to do the same thing: you have to call ElapsedMilliseconds, then 
	/// Reset(), then Start().
	/// <para/>
	/// Unlike <see cref="Loyc.Utilities.SimpleTimer"/>, this class does not start 
	/// timing when it is created, which allows it to be a struct without a 
	/// constructor.
	/// <para/>
	/// EzStopwatch behaves differently from Stopwatch when restarting, because I
	/// observed a problem using the timer to measure short time intervals. I ran
	/// trials of three operations in a loop, and the loop was programmed to run 
	/// until the total elapsed time for one of the operations exceeded 100 ms. On 
	/// each iteration I restarted the timer three times because there were three 
	/// operations to measure, and when I replaced <see cref="SimpleTimer"/> with 
	/// <see cref="EzStopwatch"/> for greater accuracy, the loop ran forever! The
	/// problem was that (depending on the benchmark's input parameters) the 
	/// operation could take less than 1 millisecond to complete, so 
	/// <see cref="Millisec"/> always returned zero, and the total never reached
	/// 100.
	/// <para/>
	/// To solve this problem, when you "<see cref="Restart"/>" the timer, it is
	/// not completely reset to zero, but rather the current value of Millisec is
	/// subtracted from the timer. This leaves a fractional amount of time less
	/// than 1 millisecond in the timer, so that if you take two measurements 
	/// that each take 0.6 milliseconds, Millisec will return 0 the first time
	/// and 1 the second time, leaving 0.2 milliseconds on the clock.
	/// <para/>
	/// TODO: change interfaces of SimpleTimer and EzStopwatch to better resemble
	/// Stopwatch, even though the behavior of "Pause" and "Resume" is more obvious
	/// than "Stop" and "Start".
	/// </remarks>
