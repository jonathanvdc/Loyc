	/// <summary>Contains <see cref="Precedence"/> objects that represent the 
	/// precedence rules of EC#.</summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Summary:
	/// <br/>100+: Primary: x.y x::y f(x) a[i] etc.
	/// <br/>90+: Prefix: +  -  !  ~  ++x  --x  (T)x 
	/// <br/>80+: Power: x**y
	/// <br/>70+: Mult: * / %
	/// <br/>60+: Add: + -     (Shift is 56 but ideally would be 70)
	/// <br/>50+: Range: ..    (`custom operators` are 28 to 55)
	/// <br/>40+: Compare: &lt; > &lt;= >= is as using == !=
	/// <br/>30+: Bitwise &^|  (Ideally would be 54..59)
	/// <br/>20+: Conditional && || ^^
	/// <br/>10+: Ternary
	/// <br/> 1:  Assignment
	/// <br/>-1:  Lambda (only the right-hand side of '=>')
	/// <para/>
	/// When printing an expression, we avoid emitting <c>x & y == z</c> because 
	/// the ranges of == and & overlap. Instead <see cref="EcsNodePrinter"/> prints 
	/// <c>#&(x, y == z)</c>. Admittedly this is rather ugly, but you can enable
	/// the <see cref="EcsNodePrinter.AllowExtraParenthesis"/> option, which allows 
	/// parenthesis to be added so that a Loyc tree with the structure 
	/// <c>#&(x, y == z)</c> is emitted as <c>x & (y == z)</c>, even though the 
	/// latter is a slightly different tree.
	/// <para/>
	/// Most of the operators use a range of two adjacent numbers, e.g. 10..11. 
	/// This represents a couple of ideas for future use in a compiler that allows
	/// you to define new operators; one idea is, you could give new operators the
	/// "same" precedence as existing operators, but make them immiscible with 
	/// those operators... yet still make them miscible with another new operator.
	/// For instance, suppose you define two new operators `glob` and `fup` with
	/// PrecedenceRange 41..41 and 40..40 respectively. Then neither can be mixed
	/// with + and -, but they can be mixed with each other and `fup` has higher
	/// precedence. Maybe this is not very useful, but hey, why not? If simply
	/// incrementing a number opens up new extensibility features, I'm happy to
	/// do it. (I could have used a non-numeric partial ordering system to do
	/// the same thing, but it would have been more complex, and of questionable
	/// value.)
	/// </remarks>
